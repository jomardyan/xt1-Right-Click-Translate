# Privacy Policy for Right-click Translate

**Effective date:** December 2, 2025  

This Privacy Policy describes how the browser extension **Right-click Translate** (the "Extension") provided by **jomardyan** ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when used in supported browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

By installing or using the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Extension as distributed through:
- The Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.
- The Microsoft Edge Add-ons store for Microsoft Edge.

It does not apply to third-party translation services (Google Translate, DeepL, Bing Translator, Yandex Translate, Microsoft Translator, or MyMemory API) that are accessed through the Extension, each of which operates under its own privacy policy.

## 2. Data Collection and Processing

**Right-click Translate does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII) on our servers.**

Specifically, the Extension itself does **not**:
- Collect or transmit your browsing history, URLs, or search queries to our servers
- Send your IP address or device identifiers to us
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies for analytics
- Track your behavior across websites for marketing or profiling
- Perform any analytics or user tracking on our behalf
- Store your translated text or selections on external servers

The Extension operates as a client-side tool that facilitates access to third-party translation services selected by you.

## 3. Local Processing and Storage

### Extension Settings
The Extension stores the following data **locally in your browser** using chrome.storage:
- **User preferences**: Source language, target languages, translation provider choice
- **Translation history**: Recently used language pairs for quick access
- **Options**: Tab behavior (new tab vs. current tab), preview settings, theme preference
- **Menu configuration**: Your saved target language list

### Data Storage Location
- All settings and history are stored **only in your browser's local storage** (chrome.storage.sync)
- This data can sync across your devices if you're signed into Chrome/Edge with sync enabled
- We have no servers, no databases, and no access to any information stored by the Extension
- You can clear this data at any time by removing the Extension or clearing browser data

## 4. Third-Party Translation Services

### How Translation Works
When you use the Extension to translate text:
1. You select text on a web page
2. You trigger translation via right-click menu or keyboard shortcut
3. The Extension sends **only the selected text** to your chosen translation provider
4. The translation provider processes the text and returns the translation

### Third-Party Services
The Extension provides access to the following third-party translation services:

#### Translation Provider Websites
- **Google Translate** (translate.google.com)
- **DeepL** (deepl.com/translator)
- **Bing Translator** (bing.com/translator)
- **Yandex Translate** (translate.yandex.com)
- **Microsoft Translator** (translator.microsoft.com)

When you select these providers, the Extension opens their website in a browser tab with your selected text pre-filled. The provider's privacy policy applies to that interaction.

#### Preview Translation API
- **MyMemory API** (api.mymemory.translated.net)

When preview mode is enabled (optional), the Extension sends selected text to MyMemory API for quick translation preview. This is a third-party service, and their privacy policy applies.

### Third-Party Data Sharing
The Extension **only** shares data with third parties when:
- You explicitly trigger a translation (selected text is sent to your chosen provider)
- Preview mode is enabled and you select text (sent to MyMemory API)

**Important Notes:**
- The Extension does not control third-party services' data handling practices
- Each translation provider has its own privacy policy
- You can disable preview mode in Extension settings to avoid MyMemory API requests
- The Extension itself does not log, store, or analyze the text you translate

### Third-Party Privacy Policies

- [Google Translate Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [DeepL Privacy Policy](https://www.deepl.com/privacy)
- [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement)
- [Yandex Privacy Policy](https://yandex.com/legal/confidential/)

Given that the Extension itself does not collect or transmit personal data to our servers, most data protection obligations do not apply to us. However, third-party services you access through the Extension may have their own compliance obligations.

### Extension Security
- The Extension operates entirely client-side in your browser
- No external servers are operated or controlled by us

### Your Responsibility
