# Privacy Policy for Right-click Translate

**Effective date:** 2025-01-01  

This Privacy Policy describes how the browser extension **Right-click Translate** (the "Extension") provided by **Hayk Jomardyan** ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when used in supported browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

By installing or using the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Extension as distributed through:
- The Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.
- The Microsoft Edge Add-ons store for Microsoft Edge.

It does not apply to any websites, services, or applications that may be linked from the Extension but are operated by third parties under their own privacy policies.

## 2. Data collection and processing

- The Extension does **not** collect, store, or process any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII).  
- The Extension does **not** collect or transmit your browsing history, URLs, search queries, IP address, device identifiers, cookies, or similar identifiers.  
- The Extension does **not** track your behavior across websites, and does **not** perform any profiling or analytics.

All features of the Extension are designed to work without requiring any personal or sensitive user data, in line with data minimization expectations for Chrome and Edge extensions.

## 3. Local processing and storage

- All processing performed by the Extension occurs locally within your browser.  
- Any settings, preferences, or cached data used by the Extension (if any) are stored only in your browser's local storage or synchronized storage associated with your browser account.  
- We do not have access to this locally stored information and do not retrieve it to our own servers.

## 4. Third-party services

- The Extension does **not** use third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or tracking pixels.  
- The Extension does **not** embed third-party SDKs or scripts for the purpose of collecting user data.  
- The Extension offers an optional preview translation feature that uses the MyMemory public translation API (`https://api.mymemory.translated.net/`). When enabled, only the selected text you choose to translate is sent to this service. No personal data, browsing history, or identifiers are shared. This feature can be disabled in the Extension's options.
- When you trigger a translation, the selected text is sent to your chosen translation provider (Google, DeepL, Bing, Yandex, or Microsoft). Each provider operates under its own privacy policy.

## 5. Permissions

The Extension may request certain browser permissions that are technically required for its functionality (for example, access to specific sites, tabs, or storage).  
Requesting a permission does **not** mean that personal data is collected; permissions are only used to provide the core features of the Extension and not for data harvesting or tracking, in accordance with Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons policies.

The Extension requests the following permissions:
- `contextMenus`: To add the right-click menu entry.
- `tabs`: To open or replace the page with the translation provider.
- `storage`: To save options, targets, and history across devices.
- `scripting` + `activeTab`: To capture the current selection for the keyboard shortcut.
- `notifications`: To show quick preview messages.
- Host permissions for `https://api.mymemory.translated.net/*`: To enable optional preview translations using the MyMemory API.

## 6. Children's privacy

Because the Extension does not collect, store, or process any personal information, it does not knowingly collect information from children of any age.  
If this changes in a future version, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect the applicable requirements for children's data protection.

## 7. User rights and controls

Since the Extension does not collect or store personal data on our servers, there is no personal data for us to access, modify, export, or delete on your behalf.  
You may at any time:
- Disable the Extension from your browser's extensions/add-ons page.
- Uninstall the Extension, which will remove it and any associated local data stored by the browser.

For Chrome and Edge, you can manage or remove extensions from the respective extensions management pages provided by the browser.

## 8. International data transfers

Because we do not collect or store personal data, there are no international transfers of personal data related to the Extension.  
If future versions begin to collect data, this section will be updated to describe any applicable transfers and safeguards.

## 9. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in:
- The functionality or behavior of the Extension.
- Applicable laws, regulations, or store policies for Chrome or Edge extensions.

When changes are made, the "Effective date" at the top of this document will be updated. Material changes will be reflected in the latest version of the policy made available via the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons listing pages.
